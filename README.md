Look at rough_idea.png first. Then read:

Idea is a previewer for a sports match. I want to preview as a betting dashboard comparing two teams. 

All py files generate the simple matplotlib graphs you see in a basic layout in the rough_idea.png. First we will work on layout and design and then improve the design and labels, information on hover etc. There are more instructions in each py file. Your expertise should be in redesigning these as Bokeh, plotly interactive graphs with further instruction in each py file.

As you can see i'm working off csv and there is no need for SQL solution at this time. This is the only data coming in: no live feeds, updating etc. All comes from _preview.csv.

Ideally, you would input two teams - or choose an unplayed match (where ft1 column is empty) - from dropdown list and thus preview the game. Right now you see i'm hardcoding Leinster and Munster as teams. 

For implementation, it can be either a CLI or flask/django solution but i'll hire based on best idea's for visualization. Please propose how you would like to do the project along with an initial cost/hours budget and we can discuss.

I hope this all makes sense and please contact with specific questions if you have any.
