Idea is a previewer for a sports match. I want to preview as a betting dashboard comparing two teams. 

Ideally, you would input two teams - or choose an unplayed match (where ft1 column is empty) - from dropdown list and thus preview the game. 

All py files generate the simple graphs you see in a basic layout in the rough_idea.png. First we will work on layout and design and then improve the design and labels, information on hover etc. There are more instructions in each py file.

As you can see i'm working off csv and there is no need for SQL solution at this time.

For implementation, it can be either a CLI or browser solution but i'll hire based on best idea's for visualization. Please propose how you would like to do the project along with an initial cost/hours budget and we can discuss.

I hope this all makes sense and please contact with specific questions if you have any.
